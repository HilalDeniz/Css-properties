            <li id="first-paragraph">HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of
                the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual
                and aural) layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the
                basis of building Web pages and Web Applications. Learn more below about:

                <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:

                Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
                Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
                Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information,
                making reservations, ordering products, etc.
                Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.

                <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.
                It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small
                screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The
                separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and
                tailor pages to different environments.
